I've recently joined the legions of Docker fans that can't stop talking about how darn fast deployment is with containerization. Don't get me wrong - I love spinning up an EC2 instance on AWS as much as the next dev; but for truly lightweight, lightning fast deployment you simply cannot go past Docker. Plus, it's now native to Mac!
