Javascript is a stock-standard component of every budding web dev's toolbelt. I've been using Javascript for the good part of the last decade. Javascript has come a long way since back then; its latest rendition - ES6 - has created even faster ways to develop web content. Ive got a couple of neat little projects below that utilise Javascript, including jQuery and JSON callbacks. Check it out and let me know what you think!
